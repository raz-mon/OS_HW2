- Where is the 'state' field of each process changed to 'unused' in the beginning of the execution?
    Can't find it.

- How can I get the number of cpus?
    Or can I assume that they are as NCPU?

- In the original scheduler - why is there 'interon()' after each 'epoch' (i.e., after we go over whole proc array)???

- Who exactly is the 'waitlock' in exit (appears in more places)?


Todo:

- Change wakeup - to iterate over the sleeping list!! See assignment specification!
    This is part of the assignment.
