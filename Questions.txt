Make sure we implemented the following correct:
    - Implementation of allocpid (cas instead of pidlock).
    - Implementation of the CAS function (assembly, in cas.S).
    - Implementation of Linked-List.
    - If we want to introduce NULL (=0) to the program, where is it best to do so? (At proc.c at the moment).
    - In page 4, in the linked-list implementation sector, what is the meaning of:
        "In addition, since your CAS implementation is for int (32 bit) and
        not uint64, you canâ€™t use it for pointers (as those are uint64 in Xv6). Thus, your linked list implementation
        will have to refer to the next link by using indices rather then pointer."
        ??
      Does this mean that the 'data' field of each link is an index of the process in the proc structure (array of 
      struct proc)?
    - ttt
