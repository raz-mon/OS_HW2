- Where is the 'state' field of each process changed to 'unused' in the beginning of the execution?
    Can't find it.

- Make sure that 'cpuid()' actually returns the index of the current cpu in the cpus array.

- How can I get the number of cpus?
    Or can I assume that they are as NCPU?



Todo:
- Add a variable to take the number of cpu's running in current execution.
    Use this value for the for-loops I conduct over the relevant cpus structure (array).

- Add a 'dummy-process' for each list - So we can lock it when we check if the list is empty and shit.
    According to the presentation they sent (for the insert and remove operations), it seems that this lock is taken
    for insert and remove too (not only for the check).
    OR MAYBE CAN USE CAS IN-ORDER TO UPDATE THAT FIRST ONE --> WON'T NEED ANY DUMMY! JUST NEED TO DO IT SMARTLY.
    Sadly, it does not make up for the Critical Section.. At least not the way I implemented it now.
    BUT, I can also use an integer as such a 'head-dummy', and 'lock & release' it with cas. That sounds good.

- Steal - still making problems (aqcuire).
