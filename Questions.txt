- Where is the 'state' field of each process changed to 'unused' in the beginning of the execution?
    Can't find it.

- Make sure that 'cpuid()' actually returns the index of the current cpu in the cpus array.

- How can I get the number of cpus?
    Or can I assume that they are as NCPU?



Todo:
- Add a variable to take the number of cpu's running in current execution.
    Use this value for the for-loops I conduct over the relevant cpus structure (array).

- Add a 'dummy-process' for each list - So we can lock it when we check if the list is empty and shit.
    According to the presentation they sent (for the insert and remove operations), it seems that this lock is taken
    for insert and remove too (not only for the check).

- Steal - still making problems (aqcuire).
