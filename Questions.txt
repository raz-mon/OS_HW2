Questions:

- In the original scheduler - why is there 'interon()' after each 'epoch' (i.e., after we go over whole proc array)???


- Where is the 'state' field of each process changed to 'unused' in the beginning of the execution?
    Can't find it.

Todo:




Lock ordering:
    Currently, I take the p->lock first, and then any cpu.head_lock or other list lock in MOST CASES.
    Problematic places:
        - Scheduler is the opposite (this should not be a problem - since we are dealing with the cpu's ready-list, which
          should be traversed only by this cpu (no access to other cpus!)).
        - allocproc (but this is not a problem, since we are dealing with the unused list, so nobody should be holding 
          the process lock).
    So seems like no problem :)
