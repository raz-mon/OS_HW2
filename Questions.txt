- Where is the 'state' field of each process changed to 'unused' in the beginning of the execution?
    Can't find it.

- How can I get the number of cpus?
    Or can I assume that they are as NCPU?

- The new note - relevant only for the taking of the locks in our linked-lists - take them by order (?).



Todo:
- Understand how to get the current number of running cpus (if we need to), and assign that value to the global variable num_cpus in proc.c.
    Currently initialized to 3.

- Make sure implementation of head-locking is good (I think it's great).

- Add balancing optimization to kill also (AS WAKEUP, add it to the proper list in each of the states of BLNCFLG).

- Steal - still making problems (aqcuire).
    Possible problem - wakeup - should traverse the sleeping list.. (Can lock the head while doing so I think..).
