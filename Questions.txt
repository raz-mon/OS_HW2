- Where is the 'state' field of each process changed to 'unused' in the beginning of the execution?
    Can't find it.

- How can I get the number of cpus?
    Or can I assume that they are as NCPU?

- In the original scheduler - why is there 'interon()' after each 'epoch' (i.e., after we go over whole proc array)???

- Who exactly is the 'waitlock' in exit (appears in more places)?


Todo:




Lock ordering:
    Currently, I take the p->lock first, and then any cpu.head_lock or other list lock in MOST CASES.
    Problematic places:
        - Scheduler is the opposite.
        - allocproc (but this is not a problem, since we are dealing with the unused list, so nobody should be holding 
          the process lock).
